Presently, the wide range of commonly-used formats for generating indoor maps means that many who would use indoor map applications either must convert indoor map data to another format or re-create the map, which can be time-consuming, costly, and even result in a flawed map. Because the problem is not recognized widely, the benefits that would come from solving it are not widely~considered, and so indoor-map related software is not evolving rapidly.},

  abstract = {As the capacity of the mobile web continues to increase with the introduction of new web technologies, a growing number of "non-programming" developers are looking to web-based mobile applications (or "web apps") as an alternative means of creating and deploying content, without the need for code-based programming experience. This paper demonstrates just some of the capabilities of a web-based application built using HTML5 and CSS3. Although this paper focuses on the development process for two web app prototypes built exclusively for the iPhone platform, theoretically, a web application can be presented on other mobile devices with browsers that support HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. It was found that these web apps were capable of producing a comparable standard of user experience as their native application equivalents. The use of the latest web technologies provides "non-programming" developers with a viable alternative for developing apps on mobile devices.},

  abstract = {With the adoption of indoor positioning solutions, which enable for a variety of location-based spatial services, a number of indoor map standards and formats have been proposed in the last decade. As each of these indoor map standard has its own purpose, the strengths and weaknesses are necessary to be understood and analyzed before selecting one of them for a given application. The Indoor Map Subcommittee has been established under IPIN/ISC in 2017. Among others, the goal of this working group is to compare available indoor map standards, provide a guideline for their application and advise on changes to their standardization development organizations if necessary. In this paper we present a survey of indoor map standards as an achievement of the subcommittee. The scope of the survey covers official standards such as IFC of BuildingSmart, IndoorGML and CityGML of OGC, and Indoor OpenStreetMap. We present several use-cases to show and discuss how to build indoor maps.},
