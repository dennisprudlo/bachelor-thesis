Presently, the wide range of commonly-used formats for generating indoor maps means that many who would use indoor map applications either must convert indoor map data to another format or re-create the map, which can be time-consuming, costly, and even result in a flawed map. Because the problem is not recognized widely, the benefits that would come from solving it are not widely~considered, and so indoor-map related software is not evolving rapidly.},

This paper demonstrates just some of the capabilities of a web-based application built using HTML5 and CSS3. Although this paper focuses on the development process for two web app prototypes built exclusively for the iPhone platform, theoretically, a web application can be presented on other mobile devices with browsers that support HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. It was found that these web apps were capable of producing a comparable standard of user experience as their native application equivalents. The use of the latest web technologies provides "non-programming" developers with a viable alternative for developing apps on mobile devices.},

As each of these indoor map standard has its own purpose, the strengths and weaknesses are necessary to be understood and analyzed before selecting one of them for a given application. The Indoor Map Subcommittee has been established under IPIN/ISC in 2017. Among others, the goal of this working group is to compare available indoor map standards, provide a guideline for their application and advise on changes to their standardization development organizations if necessary. In this paper we present a survey of indoor map standards as an achievement of the subcommittee. The scope of the survey covers official standards such as IFC of BuildingSmart, IndoorGML and CityGML of OGC, and Indoor OpenStreetMap. We present several use-cases to show and discuss how to build indoor maps.},

  abstract = {Research in support of indoor mapping and modelling (IMM) has been active for over thirty years. This research has come in the form of As-Built surveys, Data structuring, Visualisation techniques, Navigation models and so forth. Much of this research is founded on advancements in photogrammetry, computer vision and image analysis, computer graphics, robotics, laser scanning and many others. While IMM used to be the privy of engineers, planners, consultants, contractors, and designers, this is no longer the case as commercial enterprises and individuals are also beginning to apply indoor models in their business process and applications. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, the last two decades have seen greater use of spatial information by enterprises and the public. Secondly, IMM has been complimented by advancements in mobile computing and internet communications, making it easier than ever to access and interact with spatial information. Thirdly, indoor modelling has been advanced geometrically and semantically, opening doors for developing user-oriented, context-aware applications. This reshaping of the public's attitude and expectations with regards to spatial information has realised new applications and spurred demand for indoor models and the tools to use them. This paper examines the present state of IMM and considers the research areas that deserve attention in the future. In particular the paper considers problems in IMM that are relevant to commercial enterprises and the general public, groups this paper expects will emerge as the greatest users IMM. The subject of indoor modelling and mapping is discussed here in terms of Acquisitions and Sensors, Data Structures and Modelling, Visualisation, Applications, Legal Issues and Standards. Problems are discussed in terms of those that exist and those that are emerging. Existing problems are those that are currently being researched. Emerging problems are those problems or demands that are expected to arise because of social changes, technological advancements, or commercial interests. The motivation of this work is to define a set of research problems that are either being investigated or should be investigated. These will hopefully provide a framework for assessing progress and advances in indoor modelling. The framework will be developed in the form of a problem matrix, detailing existing and emerging problems, their solutions and present best practices. Once the framework is complete it will be published online so that the IMM community can discuss and modify it as necessary. When the framework has reached a steady state an empirical benchmark will be provided to test solutions to posed problems. A yearly evaluation of the problem matrix will follow, the results of which will be published.},
